## ✨ Overview

**AI SignLang Tutor** is an educational tool built to help bridge communication gaps for the **deaf and hard-of-hearing community**. It translates between **text/voice and Indian Sign Language (ISL)** and includes a simulated **AI tutor** experience using **Amazon Q logic**, voice synthesis, and real-time gesture recognition.

This project was developed for the [AWS Breaking Barriers Hackathon 2025](https://devpost.com/...), where the focus is on building **inclusive applications powered by AWS Generative AI + next-gen connectivity**.

## 🧩 Example AI Tutor Prompts

| Question                  | AI Response (ISL explanation)                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| How to sign “hello”?     | Salute starting from the forehead.                         |
| What is the sign for “father”? | Thumb touches forehead with fingers spread.                |
| How to sign “thank you”? | Fingers at chin, move forward like blowing a kiss.         |
| How to sign “red”?       | Brush index finger down lips.                              |
| What is the ISL for “friend”? | Hook both index fingers together in both directions.      |
